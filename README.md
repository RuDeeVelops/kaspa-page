# Kaspa ROI App

A modern, static web app that visualizes Kaspa's annualized ROI and compares it to major assets (S&P 500, Bitcoin, Nasdaq, Gold) since May 26, 2022. Includes a shareable screenshot feature and daily auto-updating prices via GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Kaspa ROI Dashboard**: See Kaspa's annualized return since inception.
- **Benchmarks**: Compare Kaspa to S&P 500, Bitcoin, Nasdaq, and Gold.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Static App**: All logic runs in the browser, with no server required.
- **Price Constants**: Current prices for all assets are stored as constants in `App.jsx`.
- **GitHub Actions**: The workflow `.github/workflows/update-prices.yml` runs daily, executing `scripts/update-prices.js` to fetch the latest prices and update `App.jsx`.
- **No API Quota Issues**: Only the GitHub Action fetches prices, so user traffic never hits the APIs.

## ü§ñ Automated Price Updates

- The script at `scripts/update-prices.js` fetches the latest prices for:
  - Kaspa (CoinGecko)
  - S&P 500, Bitcoin, Nasdaq, Gold (FMP API)
- It updates the constants in `src/App.jsx`.
- The GitHub Actions workflow runs this script daily and pushes changes automatically.
